# TMXtoCSV

What is TMX? (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_Memory_eXchange)
TMX is an XML specification for the exchange of translation memory (TM) data between computer-aided translation and localization tools with little or no loss of critical data.
TMX looks like an html page, so it's hard to view, analyze or gain insights in its form. So I had to write a script to convert TMX to CSV. So that I can create a dataframe and perform analysis.
